# Codecool Quest

This is a simple tile-based RPG game.

## Opening the project

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA. This is a Maven project, so you will need to open `pom.xml`.

The project is using JavaFX.  Use the `javafx` maven plugin to build and run the program.

Build:

```bash
mvn javafx:compile
```

Run:

```bash
mvn javafx:run
```

## Architecture

The project is meant to teach the concept of **layer separation**. All of the game logic (that is, player movement, game rules, and so on), is in the `logic` package, completely independent of user interface code. In principle, you could implement a completely different interface (terminal, web, Virtual Reality...) for the same logic code.
